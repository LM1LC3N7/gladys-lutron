# Integration image.
#
# Gladys sandbox constraints ("the sandbox is the defense"):
#   - rootfs mounted READ-ONLY -> never write outside /data
#   - a single writable volume: /data
#   - runs as a non-root user
#   - multi-arch image (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64), see the build workflow
#
# The image needs nothing from the Internet at runtime: the integration only
# talks to Gladys and to the Lutron bridge on the local network.
